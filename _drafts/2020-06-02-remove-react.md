In the face of police violence toward Black Americans I feel mostly helpless. I'm not in the path of police violence, I'm white, employed and comfortable, and with two kids depending on my income, it's easy to remain silent. That said, it's imporant to state: Black Lives Matter.

But I want to examine a little deeper how I'm complicit in a system of white supremacy. And, no, I don't particularly want to address my personal prejudices, built-in racist ideas, or other errors and mistakes I've made in my life. This is (mostly) a technical blog after all. But there was a thread on twitter the other day that nibbled at my brain, and brought up some latent thoughts.

Facebook has shown itself to be a bad actor. This has been demonstrated at many different points, most relevent to the moment is that the company allowed a threat to be posted there by the President of the United States against our citizens. I'm uniteresting in debating whether they should take that post down or not. This is just one of many problems the company continues to exhibit, my axiom stands, Facebook is bad for society.

> If Facebook is bad for society, and React is a tool for recruitment and on-boarding at Facebook, then I need to divest from React.

On my resume, about half of my sellings points involve React. (The other half is Drupal, :waves: hi Drupal!) At work I'm currently working on a React project, and I wouldn't be surprised if more come down the pipeline. So how do I divest from this project that supports a terrible organization?

### 1. Grieve
I first encountered React as a Junior Developer and was in awe and wonder. For whatever reason it seemed like a magical new toy, that I was curious and excited about. Once I started learning React, I felt like the programming world opened up to me. The unidirectional data-flow encouraged by the framework meshed perfectly with the way I think about data. Some people complain about JSX, but I loved the way it reflects HTML. All this and more made learning, and then applying React a pleasure. I really didn't feel like a real developer until I deployed React. 

I'm going to loose that. I need to loose that. Step one for me is a mental step. From this point on I'm going to bind closely in my mind the React project to the company Facebook. This will drain the pleasure and joy that comes from using the tool.

Goodbye sweet React.

### 2. Learn new stuff
After the sadness of step one, step two is a joy! I've wanted to go beyond "hello world" in Vue for a while, and this is a chance. Plus there's other exciting frameworks out there, Svelte and Ember to name a few. Hey, maybe I should focus on the backend more.

Whatever project I next focus on (or 5 projects, let's be real), I will again attempt to be conscious of where the project comes from, and who benefits from more engagement. Should I choose Angular, which is a Google propery? Is Google as bad as Facebook? Does Google actually benefit with more engagment with Angular if they don't use it in house? (That's supposed to be a dig.) 

There will never be an apolitical choice, and neither will there be a perfect one. The best I can do going forward is to be conscious of the choice.


### 3. Push for other tools at work
The place where the rubber meets the road will be when I'm asked what tool would work for a given problem, or client. I need be deep enough into step two to be able to offer alternatives and give cogent answers as to why. 

I think not supporting Facebook is a good reason, but it won't be enough in a business envionment.

### 4. Write about other tools
It's not like anyone reads my blog, but every bit of non-React writing out in the world will help to diminish the influence of React.

## The React team
I don't know anyone on the React team personally, but some of them have a strong presence online. I count some of them as my most important Twitter follows, and people I respect for their technical writing, as well as their personal bearing. Saying "diminish the influence of React," even as limited my influence is, feels like I'm slapping them in the face.

## Actual effect
Nothing in this article is a personal sacrifice. If anything, if I really follow through on this, I become more employable, and more value to my employer.
