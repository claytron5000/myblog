There has been continuous road constructions along my commute down Route 91 for
a few years. This gives me a lot of time to think deep thoughts about traffic,
organizations, and the way individuals interact with one another and in groups.

One of my pet peeves during construction is when drives merge to early. I suspected
the problem is worst when drivers can see the construction from farther away. This
leads drivers to quickly switch to the open lane way before the merging lane closes.
I've been stuck in traffic jams composed of one lane for a mile or more while a perfectly
open lane sits right next to us. My rule for myself is: don't switch lanes until
the last moment. Yeah, I'm that guy. And people get _pissed_. I've seen drivers
swing out into the middle of the road in an attempt to block anyone from passing
them in the empty lane... miles before construction. I don't want to dwell on the
psychology of people who are so upset that someone might get to their destination
a few minutes early, instead I want to point out, we'd all get there faster if we
used both lanes.

I'm no traffic expert, so you'll have to take it on faith, but common sense tells
us that two miles of single-lane traffic is going to be slower than 1/2 mile of
single-lane traffic. But people have heard mentality, and that serves us well most
of the time. What's needed in this situation is clear road signage that serves two
purposes: warn drivers that construction and merging is ahead, and encourage the
effective use of _zippering_. `YKK` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wgSjstvsPc&feature=youtu.be
