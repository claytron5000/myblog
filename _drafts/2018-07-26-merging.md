There has been continuous road constructions along my commute down Route 91 fora few years. This gives me a lot of time to think deep thoughts about traffic,organizations, and the way individuals interact with one another and in groups.

One of my pet peeves during construction is when drives merge to early. I suspectedthe problem is worst when drivers can see the construction from farther away. Thisleads drivers to quickly switch to the open lane way before the merging lane closes.I've been stuck in traffic jams composed of one lane for a mile or more while a perfectlyopen lane sits right next to us. My rule for myself is: don't switch lanes untilthe last moment. Yeah, I'm that guy. And people get _pissed_. I've seen driversswing out into the middle of the road in an attempt to block anyone from passingthem in the empty lane... miles before construction. I don't want to dwell on thepsychology of people who are so upset that someone might get to their destinationa few minutes early, instead I want to point out, we'd all get there faster if weused both lanes.
I'm no traffic expert, so you'll have to take it on faith, but common sense tellsus that two miles of single-lane traffic is going to be slower than 1/2 mile ofsingle-lane traffic. But people have heard mentality, and that serves us well mostof the time. What's needed in this situation is clear road signage that serves twopurposes: warn drivers that construction and merging is ahead, and encourage the effective use of the _zipper merge_.

I'm not the only one on the crusade, the Kansas department of transportation produced a high quality video

There's a few valiant efforts at creating the right sign for the zipper merge, none of which I think are perfect. The part that's missing, IMO, is a sign preceding the zipper merge that actually disuades drivers from the early merge.
