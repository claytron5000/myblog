The last post on here was about migrating to Hugo. It looks like I never
finished the migration, so I'll just leave it in Jekyll. I really have nothing
to write about at the moment, I just wanted to add something.

Also, it's both been a long time, and not as long as I thought since I've
updated this blog. Somehow I posted twice in the middle of the pandemic and yet
didn't write about it at all. Weirdly distance, my dude.

Maybe I can post more frequently than once every 4 years.
