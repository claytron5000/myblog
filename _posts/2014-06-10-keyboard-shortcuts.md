I spent a solid hour this morning perfecting my keyboard shortcuts. Productivity, at this point, is really more of a feeling than something to measure. I&#8217;m sure if I actually measured the amount of time saved by Command + Tab versus using the mouse I would only be saving a few seconds every day. The point of streamlining my computer processes is not the time saved, but the feeling of streamlining. When I can effectively navigate around the applications I&#8217;m using, from text to command-line, to browser I feel like I&#8217;m a slick cyber-warrior. It&#8217;s that feeling that gets me to do more work, work faster and harder, and get shit done. The actual time saved is miniscule and hardly worth noting. It&#8217;s all about the cool.

Here&#8217;s the ones that I work with mostly:

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">ctrl + space </span>Quicksilver<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> application launcher</span>

cmd + tab navigate through open applications

cmd + h hide application. I would like a &#8220;hide window&#8221; option, though I don&#8217;t think that exists outside the Minimize option. I only occasionally minimize something I want on in the background. The problem with minimize is I can&#8217;t recall the window without mousing over to it in the dock. That said, I just found out you can use the cmd+tab chooser plus the 1 key to choose windows&#8230; this is why I write these things, to learn more.

These next two are too similar in form and function. I need to decide if I want to change one of the keystrokes to something different, or to only open new windows and skip tabs altogether.

cmd + \` navigate through windows in application

ctrl + tab navigate through tabs in Chrome + other browsers

cmd +w always closing windows

cmd + n new window

option + arrow  this one seem to not work in some applications, I just can&#8217;t figure out which. it&#8217;s on the text-level and moves the cursor from word to word.

cmd + arrow simliar to the one above, but moves the end or beggining of  a line.
