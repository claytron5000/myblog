January was a rough month in our household. Tiffany and James were ill early in the month. I caught the bug a week later and it&#8217;s still hanging on.

When James was sick he would wake up at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and be awake for hours. This happened when he was feverish and a couple times when he wasn&#8217;t. This was accompanied by toddler craziness: refusal to eat, insistence on off-limits toys(wall sockets), and other bad behavior I don&#8217;t want to recall. After a couple weeks it settled down and we realised he&#8217;d grown an inch and gained a pound or two. Attribute it to growth spurt.

One of the unexpected consequences of all that sleep-deprivation is that I&#8217;m now an early riser. We&#8217;ve all been early-ish risers since he was born, but now I&#8217;m awake at 4:30 &#8211; 5:30 with no prompting.

And you know what, I like it.

It&#8217;s very quiet in this hour before the family gets up. I can usually finish one task. I drink two cups of coffee and it feels good. I guess that I&#8217;m finally being the old man I always wanted to be.
