I recently did Â a quick redesign of my work website <a href="http://artbuildcreative.com" target="_blank">artbuildcreative.com</a>. I whipped up this design flat in photoshop. Those grey rectangles are thumbnail links to projects.<a style="line-height: 1.5; color: #41a62a; outline: #000000;" href="/images/2014/04/ArtBuildRedesign.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-40" alt="ArtBuildRedesign" src="/images/2014/04/ArtBuildRedesign-300x183.jpg" width="300" height="183" /></a>

I&#8217;ve also been working with the twitter bootstrap framework. It&#8217;s simple a set of CSS and Javascript libraries that make laying out and building responsive websites very easy. It includes a whole slew of pre-built classes to do this from formatting: &#8220;.col-md-6&#8221; to assets &#8220;.btn-navbar&#8221; and more. The final layout is slightly different, but follows the spirit and feel of the original design. Because it&#8217;s basically a flat brochure site with very little content it only took a day + to complete.
